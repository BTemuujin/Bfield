# Bfield

This is a external magnetic field I have implemented in VASP 5.3.3 and 5.3.5 with a help of Ming Ye. It was used to study the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient in a multiferroic compound Sr0.5Ba0.5MnO3. Reference is here: https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.217204

There are other VASP source code modifications are necessary to fully implement this code but I am not including them here due to licensing issues. You need to modify main, pot, and constant files. 

I will be happy to help if anyone is interested in how to implement it in VASP.
